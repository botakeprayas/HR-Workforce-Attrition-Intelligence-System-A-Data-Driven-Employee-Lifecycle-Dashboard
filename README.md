# HR Attrition & Workforce Insights Dashboard
## Problem Statement
The company is experiencing increasing employee attrition and uneven workforce distribution across departments. HR leaders need a dashboard to understand satisfaction levels, performance, compensation, and hiring trends to identify factors influencing employee turnover and improve retention.
## Data Overview
The dataset contains employee information such as demographics, job role, department, salary, satisfaction score, performance rating, experience, and attrition status. It supports detailed analysis of retention, engagement, and workforce trends.
## Project Description
The dashboard analyzes employee data using Tableau to track workforce distribution, satisfaction, performance, salaries, and attrition patterns. It enables HR to make data-driven decisions to enhance employee retention and workplace productivity.
